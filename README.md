# no-CVE-batsignal-a-macOS-LPE-in-Spotlight

This is the repository for batsignal `v1` and `v2`, I only included the latest
versions of these.

If you run into problems running these, reach out and I'll see what I can do.
These exploits went through a fair bit of iterations, and might need some
minor work.
